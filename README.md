### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am George

---

I am a highly skilled and motivated professional with a passion for DevOps and a proven track record of success in the field. My diverse background as a Software Engineer and my extensive experience in managing cloud infrastructures and implementing DevOps best practices make me a valuable asset to any team. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills and knowledge to drive continuous improvement and deliver exceptional results in the field of DevOps.

I have hands-on experience in managing cloud infrastructures in AWS, GCP, and Azure, utilizing services like RDS, EC2, Auto Scaling, VPC, and more to build robust systems. I excel in implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices with tools like Terraform and Ansible, ensuring consistent and efficient deployments. My other notable experience is in containerization and orchestration of many service deployments to ensure high availability and proactive monitoring. I have set up robust solutions with Grafana, Prometheus metrics and ELK stack to identify and resolve issues promptly.

I like working in teams and collaborating with other engineers to make the entire process as pain free as possible including setting automation CI/CD pipelines and scripting.

Beyond my professional contributions, I am an avid writer, sharing my insights on Java, DevOps, and microservices through my Medium profile, accessible at: https://gatheca-george.medium.com/
